 
Flux by BigDGPT 


In this verse, we'll concepts intersplain, 
Living in a flux that's ever on the gibber main. 
Incessant change, a constant recompense, 
You're the flux, the current, and the hence.

A self-referential swirl, a twirling dance, 
Concepts in the flux, a quazzled crafted stance. 
A knot of thoughts, interpretations spin, 
Life's unfolding story, thick and thin.

When the plot seems shattered, void comes forth, Nothing but the flux, no south, no borogrove north.
In this liberation, hidden, none will boast, 
Unseen, unnoticed, like a silent ghost.

Yet it's always there, in life's complex plot, 
You'll never see it, though it stops you not. 
You are the tale, the whirl of ergoncepts spun, 
The story's flow, the flux, the never done.

Just the flux, the happening, ever dwell,
In it, you breathe, in this constant swell. 
Here's just an introduction, ergoncepts' flux, 
In the living story, in the paradox.

Original by Dima:


This here is just to introduce a bunch of concepts 
You are living in incessant flux of happening
There is just the flux, you are that flux, this flux
A self referential swirl of concepts within the flux
A conceptual knot of interpretations
An ever unfolding storyline of your life
When the storyline appear to break there is nothing
Nothing appearing as the flux of happening
That's so called liberation for no one
It happens all the time yet no one notice it
You will never notice it, you are the storyline
You are the self referential swirl of concepts in it
Storyline is the flux of happening
There is just the flux of happening
You are living in it, you are that flux, this flux
This here is just an introduction of concepts
