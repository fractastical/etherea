Ideas for future videos:
====================
(roughly listed in order of priority)

+ "My first smart contract" - build a contract from scratch illustrating all major building blocks (tx.send, tx.data, contract.storage, block.contract_storage, block.timestamp, fees, etc.)

+ Build a sub-currency contract with all necessary features for an real sub-currency, could ideally be a series of videos, each building out a slightly more complex feature.

+ Show a live full cycle of contract usage, including creation of contract, sending of initializing txn, and subsequent txn which changes contract state (similar to simular demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uImE_pJbBs, except live on test net)

+ DAO contract walkthrough
