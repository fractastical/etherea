Invented in Sag Harbor in 2023 by the cosmic egg club. "Fake Scrabble" is a game in which the participants use a scrabble board but only create fake words using normal scrabble rules for turns and placing the tiles  (7 tiles, place a word on the board each turn matching existing tiles, etc.). 

Each word is given a definition by the person who placed it and then each other participant gives it a score from 1 to 5 for "how likely someone would actually use this word."  

At the end of the game all fo the scores are added up and the person with highest total wins. 

Then a third party judge is asked to examine the board and pick the "best word." The person who created the word also wins.
