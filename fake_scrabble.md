Hey little friends! 🚀 Let's play a super fun game called "Fake Scrabble"! It was made up by some cool people at a place called Sag Harbor in 2023. Here’s how you can play it:

What We Need:

A Scrabble game board
Letter tiles from the game
Friends or family to play with!
Let’s Play!

Make Believe Words: Use your letter tiles to make up silly, fun, or crazy words! They don’t have to be real words, just pretend ones. Each of you gets 7 letters to start, like in regular Scrabble.

Tell a Story: After you make a word, tell everyone a little story or meaning of your made-up word. Like, if your word is “Blop”, maybe it's a bubble that pops and laughs! 😄

Fun Scores: Your friends will give your word a score! They will think: "Hmm, would people really use this fun word?" They’ll give you points from 1 to 5. 5 means they super love it!

Winning: When all the tiles are used up and no one can make more words, it's time to see who won! Add up all the points your words got from your friends. The person with the most points wins!

Extra Winning: After you count the points, someone who didn't play (like mom, dad, or a big sibling) will look at all the words and pick the one they like the best! That person also wins!

Some Funny Words from Other Games:

Slove: It means someone who becomes a lovey-dovey helper because they fell in love. Like helping a naughty person because they like them. 🥰 Oops!

Example: She became a slove when she bought a house with a man who was not nice, and lost everything. 😟

Boniru: Something that's cute like a bunny’s little tail! 🐰

Example: “Oh, that dress is so boniru, I want one like it!” 💖

Remember: The most important thing is to have lots of fun and giggle lots with your made-up words! Let's start playing and creating the silliest words ever! 🎉👏🏽
