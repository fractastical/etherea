I come from a geological family with its own asteroid and word in the dictionary, namely "astrobleme." I have some desire to get my own neologisms to dictionary status, and I consider the following my most important neologisms:

# Nerdgasm

the feeling a nerd has when they become so excited about a technological idea that they will drop everything and work on it. 

Usage: "I had a nerdgasm when I read the Ethereum whitepaper on the day it came out and I immediately dropped everything I was working on and dedicated my life to working on the project" 


# Postfreudian Slip

The tendancy to inadvertently and mistakenly use platonic categories and references even when espousing a worldview that is anti-platonic. 

Usage: "The Swedish philosopher made a postfreudian slip and accidentally referred to "Gestalt" even as he attempted to debunk his opponent for reliance on some form of essentialism.  


# Hyper-Lacanianism

An integerated asyncronous form of lacanian therapy where your answers are parsed and then matched for likeness and then fed back with the use of AI.  

Usage: The artist began to delve into hyper-lacanianism to see if his true love could be found at the heart of the hyper-text labyrinth

# Slove 

"A love slave" or smeone who falls in love (usually with someone else who has bad intentions) and then becomes their slave. 

Example: She took the slove path as the guy she bought a house with seemed great at first until she realized he had placed everything in his name and she ended up losing everything.
